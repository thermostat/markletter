All we want to do is eat your brains. We're not unreasonable. (I mean,
no one's gonna eat your eyes.)

If you open up the door, we'll all come inside and eat your brains.

I'd like to help you, Tom in any way I can. I sure appriciate the way
you're working with me. I'm not a monster Tom. Well, technically I
am. I guess I am.
